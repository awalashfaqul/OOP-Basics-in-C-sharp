# OOP Basics in C#
 Practicing basics of OOP in C#

 Specially, 
 - creating a class. [example: class Cirle]
 - declaring its properties to store data. [example: private double radius;]
 - creating constructors with a parameter so that can be accessed from other classes.
   [example: pyblic Circle(double radius)
   {
   this.radius = radius;
   }]
- Creating a method to manipulate special cases. In this program, area of the circle is calculated.
